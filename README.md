# Machine-Learning-kNearestNeighbor
using Java and Weka-Framework

### Implementation
The Java-Class NearestNeighbor can be used in the Weka-Explorer as a plugin for the kNN-Algorithms. The methods which are 
already implemented are the weighted and unweighted Euclidian and Manhattan Distance Metrics.

### TODO 
Normalization of the values of the attributes. The method already exists unfinished in class NearestNeighbor.
